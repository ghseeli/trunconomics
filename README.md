# Trunconomics

This repository is to study the art of word truncation. Currently, we are testing various ideas for viability at larger scale. Our hope is to eventually have a program that can help suggest highly readable truncations of words, taking into account context if at all possible.

Note, this project is currently at ground zero and is not meant to be used in anything requiring a stable application or library. Use at your own risk!
